# CS50

I am a 21 year old business student at the University of British Columbia and an aspiring software engineer.

This repository is my first ever and will serve as a progress tracker for my journey to completing Harvard's CS50, the first stepping stone on my road to becoming a great programmer. Super excited and looking forward to it!
